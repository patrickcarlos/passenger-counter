# passenger-counter


in this challenge I created an application to count the number of people while saving the previous data.


## Lessons Learned

I used HTML to create the document and linked the CSS with a source link to style and make the document more responsive on various devices.

later I used the javascript to make the document interactive by incrementing and saving data (DOM), first I linked the html to the javascript by a source link and then in the javasript I used the variables and the functions relating the elements of the HTML document.

finally I used Github to create a repository and upload the html, css, javascript files, and deploy it on the web
